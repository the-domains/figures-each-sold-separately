  My name is Larry Hohoho from Singapore, I grew up poor but in a Happy Family
  where my Parents are thrifty and we have no need for anything that we do not
  own.  They have always instilled in my Sister and me the value of things, that
  we should not waste food and that generosity is not limited to the rich
  because we have always given what little we have to those less fortunate.   I
  grew up during the days of Star Wars (Empire Strikes Back) + Indiana Jones
  (The Temple of Doom) and consider my childhood to be the Golden Age of Toys. 
  Toy commercials are seen frequently on TV between cartoons and closing
  taglines like:"Each sold separately" & "Batteries not included" are commonly
  heard. Just like any other kid, I WANTED THEM ALL!!!  Obviously, our family
  had very little budget for new toys given our financial situation then. 
  Whatever toy we received from our Parents maximised on education values rather
  than fun.  My father Loves to swim by the seaside and while he swims with my
  Sister, my Mother would take me trawling the beaches to "rescue lost Toys"
  which the other kids have left behind.  It was like a treasure hunt mostly for
  plastic army men but we always took something back with us.  Most of our other
  Toys are pass-em-downs either given to us by relatives or my Father's
  colleagues whose kids have outgrown or no longer played with them.  We did not
  really care how they came about as those Toys that I grew up with were just
  pure GOLD.   To me, a Toy is more than just a Toy. They represent and mark
  different parts of our wonderful childhood growing up. Now that I am a Father,
  I hope I will be able to pass this culture down to my children so that they
  will be able to appreciate the finer TOYS in Life...
